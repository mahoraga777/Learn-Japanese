# 🇯🇵 Learn Japanese: The Hub

This is just a side project that i will be making to learn japanese and hope it might help you as well.

The project is currently in **Phase 1 (Hiragana)**, with modules for Katakana and Grammar in development.

I built this because I believe **Active Recall** (seeing a character and typing the answer) is the fastest way to build muscle memory.
we don't need to write in order to learn and we can make process of learning fast.My main gole is to be able to watch anime without subtitles so

## 📂 Project Architecture
I designed the file structure to be modular so new features can be added without breaking the core application.

> **Learn-Japanese/**
> * `index.html` (Gatekeeper: Currently redirects to the Hiragana module)
> * `assets/` (Shared Resources: Anime backgrounds, Icons, Fonts)
> * `hiragana/` (MODULE 1: Hiragana Practice)
>   * `index.html`
>   * `script.js`
>   * `style.css`

> * `grammar/` (MODULE 3: Coming Soon)
